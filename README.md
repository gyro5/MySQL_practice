# MySQL Practice Exercises

A set of exercises to practice with creating MySQL queries.

Fork from <https://github.com/kiwidamien/SQL_practice> because the original repository is for PostgreSQL.

## Changes

I created Python scripts to converted the `.csv` files into `.sql` insert scripts that can be copied pasted directly into MySQL Workbench.

## How to use

- Copy, paste, and run the code in the `init-mysql.sql` file of a directory in MySQL Workbench.

- Create queries for the questions in the `README.md` file of that directory.

## Note

To practice in PostgreSQL instead, please see the original repository (Link above).
